## TODO Implement Front-End

### Feature List:

#### FEA-4

- As a user, I am able to see which posts I have authored and which I have not.

- As a user, I should be able to understand this from the UI (buttons/forms/visible/hidden).

#### FEA-6

- As a user, I am able to view categories on a given post.

#### FEA-7

- As a user, I am able to search for posts by category.
